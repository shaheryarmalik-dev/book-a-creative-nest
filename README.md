## Stripe Payments (USD hourly)

Development setup:

1. Install deps:
   - `npm i @stripe/stripe-js stripe express cors dotenv`
   - `npm i -D tsx concurrently`
2. Configure environment:
   - Create `.env` with:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # optional for local until webhook configured
SUCCESS_URL=http://localhost:8080
CANCEL_URL=http://localhost:8080
PORT=5174
```
3. Run both dev servers:
   - `npm run dev:full`
   - Vite runs on http://localhost:8080 and proxies `/api/*` to the Stripe server on 5174.

Webhook (optional in dev):
   - `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5174/api/stripe-webhook`

In the app, the booking form posts to `/api/create-checkout-session` and redirects to Stripe Checkout in USD, pricing by hours Ã— hourly rate.
